Killnet is a pro-Russian hacktivist group that started its activities in early 2022 as a DDoS and Botnet service.

When the Russian-Ukrainian war broke out, it started attacking Airport websites and other types of services via DDoS.

From April 2022 onwards, it started attacking a wider range of critical infrastructures of NATO member countries or countries positioned towards Ukraine within the war.

Killnet is a decentralized group organized in squads. These squads have no geographical links, only ideological (pro-Russian) ones. Despite having a decentralized structure, there is a head (Killmilk) who is in charge of acting as an axis between the different squads and maintaining the group's main idea.
It has also been observed that some "trustworthy men" or "commanders" are the contacts in charge of recruitment, press, and other types of coordination. Each Squad works independently and sets its victims, although from time to time, a "call to arms" is made where a series of objectives are assigned to each squad. It has not been confirmed whether these are direct orders or just proposals.
